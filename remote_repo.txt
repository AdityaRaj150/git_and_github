working directory -> staging area -> local repository(.git) -> remote repository(github)

generally by convention, we use origin as the remote repository name, main as branch
we use- git remote add origin link to create a remote repo named origin
we use- git push -u origin main to push local repo content to remote repo
we use- git remote set-url origin link to change the url that links the local repo tho remote repo
